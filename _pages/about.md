I am a graduate student jointly trained at **Tsinghua University** and the **University of Southern California**, with research interests in **misinformation**, **AI-mediated communication**, and **computational social science**.

My research examines how artificial intelligence systems—such as large language models and AI-assisted fact-checking tools—intervene in information ecosystems, and how human cognition, moral judgment, and social dynamics interact with algorithmic mediation. I combine **computational methods**, **experimental and survey designs**, and **AI-assisted text analysis** to study misinformation production, diffusion, and correction.
